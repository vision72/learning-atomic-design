# The goal is to walkthrough and understand the fundamental principles of atomic-design.

- For the learning path we are following along to create two Forms.
    1. ContactsForm
    2. SignUpForm

- For creating both of these forms we are going to illustrate and utilize atomic principles, including a demo.

- The atomic-design principle is based on three core things, atoms, molecules, and organisms.

    - Atoms are single un-diveable component which can not be further divided.
    - Molecules are higher order atoms, grouped together to create meaningful components.
    - Organisms create meaning to all the collection of these molecules which completes a component as a whole.

- In case of forms, what we generally require is a Button, Text, Input, TextArea. These can be considered as our Atoms, which can not be further dived/divided into.

- Moving onto Molecular portion of the design we require a checkbox field, Input field, Textarea field.

- Finally, we can jump into creating Organisms through our molecules component, the ContactsForm and the SignUpForm.

- Now, it is time to test the components that we build using the atomic-design principle.

- We can see that we have not provided any designs, but the goal to achieve atomic-design pattern is successful.

- Moreover what we learned was the principle to go deeper and emerging back on higher order components
